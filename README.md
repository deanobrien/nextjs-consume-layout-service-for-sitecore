![enter image description here](https://deanobrien.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wireframe-layout-768x321.jpg)

This repository contains a NextJS (created from boilerplate) with the basic functionality added to be able to consume the custom layout service (found here  [DeanOBrien GitHub: Custom layout Service for Sitecore](https://github.com/deanobrien/custom-layout-service-for-sitecore).

This repository is the companion code to support this article [DeanOBrien: NextJs App to Consume Layout Service](https://deanobrien.uk/build-a-front-end-application-to-consume-our-custom-layout-service/) where we look at creating a headless application to consume the layout service.
